# 👋 Hey there! I'm Dylan Nagel

Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about building high-impact software.

I have professional experience as a **Software Development Intern at Carta**, where I'm currently engineering an AI email routing service to automate operational costs. I also have experience as a **Full Stack Developer at Empathia.ai**, where I built a full-stack RAG system to enhance AI personalization and led the development of the company's main website.

## 🛠 Technical Skills

Here's a snapshot of the technologies I've worked with:

* **Languages:** Java, Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Bash
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, FastAPI, .NET, MonoGame
* **Cloud & Data:** AWS (S3), GCP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka
* **Tools & Workflow:** Docker, Kubernetes, n8n, Git, Jenkins, Figma, Cloudflare, Jira

## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

* **[Acronymize](https://github.com/NagelDylan/Acronymize)**
    * A full-stack word puzzle game built with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Django/PostgreSQL backend.
    * Features secure user authentication for progress tracking and a unique player feedback system using an ML sentence transformer model.

* **[FlowSense](https://github.com/NagelDylan/FlowSense)**
    * **🏆 1st Place Winner at Hack the North (out of 100+ teams)**
    * A dynamic reading platform (React, Django, PostgreSQL) that uses a RAG approach with the OpenAI GPT API to provide real-time, context-aware word explanations.

* **[Tanks](https://github.com/NagelDylan/Tanks)**
    * An object-oriented game built in C# and MonoGame based on the classic "Wii Tanks!"
    * Features personality-driven AI using the A* pathfinding algorithm for intelligent enemy movement and robust auto-aim logic.

## 🔨 What I'm Working On

I'm always exploring new ideas. Here's what I'm currently building:

1.  **BlinkTrack:** A desktop wellness app that uses your webcam and a computer vision model to monitor your blink rate. It aims to combat digital eye strain by providing gamified stats, leaderboards, and timely reminders, turning healthy eye habits into a challenge.
2.  **ContextAI:** A "second brain" browser extension that uses a RAG model to passively index your browsing history and personal notes. It will allow you to ask complex, context-aware questions about your own research and digital footprint.

## 📚 About Me

Beyond the world of code, you'll find me immersed in a good book 📖, planning out my next travel destination ✈️, or getting competitive in squash or badminton 🏸.
