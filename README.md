# 👋 Hey there! I'm Dylan Nagel (He/Him)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 🚀 I'm a passionate software developer, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. With 3 years of coding experience under my belt, I've developed a keen interest in web and game development.

## 📚 About Me

Beyond the world of code, you'll find me immersed in a good book 📖, planning out my next travel destination ✈️, or getting competitive in squash or batminton 🏸. These interests fuel my creativity and inspire my projects.

## 🛠 Languages and Frameworks

In my journey as a software developer, I've had the pleasure of working with a wide array of languages and frameworks. Here's a snapshot of what I've worked with:
